Hi there, and thanks for taking a look at my sudoku solving program.

This program takes an incomplete sudoku puzzle as input and displays the completed puzzle to the user.

A recursive backtracking algorithm is used to solve the puzzles, meaning that the program can solve any solvable sudoku puzzle
as long as it is given enough time, usually 2 - 30 seconds, depending on the complexity of the puzzle.

The entire program is written in Python, and uses pygame for its graphical user interface.

To use this application, download the repositiory files and run main.py. You must have pygame and python 3 installed for the application to run.
